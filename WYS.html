								<p><b>Committee</b>: ECOSOC
							</br><b>Topic</b>: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Economic Development and Its Potential Impact
						</br><b>Country</b>: Republic of Korea </p>
						<p>Since The Republic of Korea was founded in 1949, it has experienced the economic crisis caused by the end of World War II in 1945, the inflation because of Korean War in 1950, the Five-Year Plans of South Korea, and the global financial crisis in 2007. In 2017, South Korea’s GDP reached $1.531 trillion. However, although the Korean government invests 2.2 trillion won in AI currently for research and development, once AI is widely used in industry, the impact on the future, in addition to the known unemployment rate, will be likely to bring about more strictness inflation than that in 1945. Moreover, ethics is also a challenge.
								</p>
								<p>In June 2017, Britain took the lead in setting up the “AI Council” and strived to reach a consensus on legislation. In April 2018, “Science and Technology Daily (中国科技日报)” reported that the head of computer science at University of Oxford said that AI legislation in Britain would focus on two important aspects: exploiting opportunities and preventing hazards. What we need to do is not to copy the establishment of AI Committee in Britain, but to establish AI’s status in the world by reference, and to invite scholars from various countries to discuss the realization of AI legislation in the world, and to restrict AI’s creation, use and recycling norms by international law.
									</p>
									<p>At present, South Korea is striving to become the fourth largest AI R & D countries in the world in 2022. Hundreds of researchers have also sought to predict the possible impact on AI. The enactment of international law is helpful to the use of norms after AI research and development in Korea and to reduce the impact. Korea is willing to formulate exclusive domestic law on the basis of international law.
